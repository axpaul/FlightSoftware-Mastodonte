# Flight Software Mastodonte

**FlightSoftware-Mastodonte** is the embedded flight software running on the **YD-RP2040** controller of the experimental rocket **Mastodonte**.  
It acts as the onboard **flight sequencer**, managing time-critical events and hardware interfaces during the mission.

## ðŸš¦ Flight Sequencer States

The system is driven by a finite state machine (`sequencer.cpp`) that transitions through various mission phases.  
Each state configures RGB LED color and buzzer behavior to provide **visual and audible feedback**.

| State           | Color (LED)      | Buzzer Pattern                      | Description |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| `PRE_FLIGHT`     | ðŸŸ¢ Green          | ðŸ”ˆ Double soft beep (3s pause)       | System idle on ground, RBF and JACK expected. |
| `PYRO_RDY`       | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow         | ðŸ”ˆ 1 low beep per second             | Ready for liftoff, RBF removed, JACK still in. |
| `ASCEND`         | ðŸ”µ Blue           | ðŸ”ˆ Very fast beeping                 | Liftoff confirmed, rocket in ascent. |
| `WINDOW`         | ðŸ”µ Cyan           | ðŸ”ˆ Rapid alert beeping               | Deployment window is open (timed or triggered). |
| `DEPLOY_ALGO`    | ðŸŸ  Orange         | ðŸ”ˆ Alternating mid beeps             | Deployment triggered via algorithm (sensor). |
| `DEPLOY_TIMER`   | ðŸŸ  Orange         | ðŸ”ˆ Alternating mid beeps             | Deployment triggered via timer timeout. |
| `DESCEND`        | ðŸŸ£ Magenta        | ðŸ”ˆ Slow and regular beeping          | Descent under parachute. |
| `TOUCHDOWN`      | ðŸŸ¢ Green (steady) | ðŸ”ˆ Long beep every 30 seconds        | Touchdown detected, safe recovery state. |
| `ERROR_SEQ`      | ðŸ”´ Red            | ðŸ”ˆ Rapid high-pitched beeping        | System fault or invalid state transition. |

## ðŸ”˜ User Button USR (GP24) â€” Log Dump & Erase

A user-accessible button is connected to **GPIO 24** and is checked during system boot.

- **Press and release**: Dumps log content to Serial @ **115200 baud**.
- **Press and hold for 5 seconds**: Erases the entire log file from the onboard flash memory.

This provides a fast and safe way to extract and reset logs without reflashing the system.
